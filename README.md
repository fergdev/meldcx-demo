# Demo App

Hi here is my demo app following the spec sheet given by Meldcx. This App uses a MVVM like pattern with DataBinding, RXJava, Room and Glide. I have implemented the features to the best I can in the amount of time allocated. I did not handle background state and would like to work on showing the cached image better (some pages load but don't render fast). Future work includes using dagger to inject dependencies and implementing a better ui (designed by designer). I have also only tested this on an Android Oreo Emulator, results may vary on other android versions. Unit tests have been written for the view logic classes, no instrumentation were written for this demo.

Standard android invocations.

To run ```./gradlew installDebug```
To test ```./gradew testDebug```
